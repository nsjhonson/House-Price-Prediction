# House Price Prediction using TensorFlow Decision Forests

This project predicts house prices using the *House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques* dataset from Kaggle. It leverages *TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF)* to build a Random Forest regression model, providing accurate predictions and insights into the factors influencing house prices.
